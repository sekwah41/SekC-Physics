# SekC Physics

A work in progress physics mod for Minecraft

I was requested to finally release ragdoll physics in Minecraft so here it is :)

I will focus more on this if people are interested or if I just generally want to play around with it more.  At the moment I am currently working on a tool to help make skeleton mappings for entities and also need to add the armour layers

#### Current Development Focus
* Armour Layer Renderer
* Mapping out more mobs
* Rotational Constraits (Low priority atm)
